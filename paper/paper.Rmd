# Summary


Somatic growth of fishes is a critical trait to estimate biological processes that range from individuals to communities. In the context of fisheries, parameters describing fish growth can be used directly to estimate an important ecosystem service, i.e. food production. Further, somatic growth rate is an important part of an individual's energy budget and thus underlies bioenergetic models that estimate fluxes of energy and elements mediated by fishes. Many ecosystems are under major anthropogenic pressure, and fish populations are in decline across the globe. As billions of people depend on fishes for food security and fishes can play an important role in nutrient cycling, it is critical to increase our ability to estimate growth parameters. 

Fish growth can be estimated by relating fish length with the age. The most common method for aging fish is the analysis of growth rings found on otoliths (i.e. calcified structures of the inner ear that grow with the deposition of successive calcium carbonate layers, which respond to circadian or seasonal rhythms). Then, fish growth parameters can be estimated by fitting growth curves on the size at age data. While there are many types of growth models, the Von Bertalanffy is by far the most commonly used for fishes. This approach calls for a large sample size of individuals of a population with varying sizes. Alternatively, we can estimate individual growth trajectories by measuring the distances between growth rings, and transforming these to fish lengths, a process called back-calculation. This approach is useful because we can fit growth curves with a lot less individuals. This method is thus less destructive, i.e. we can get away with killing less individuals. However, back-calculated lengths are rough estimates that include a level of uncertainty, that is not accounted for in currently described methods and existing tools. Moreover, the nature of back-calculated lengths demands a hierarchical modeling approach to account for the autocorrelation. Developing such a model can be challenging and discouraging for the average R user, and there are currently no tools allow fitting a VBGC to back-calculated lengths.

Here, we present `fishgrowbot`, an R package that provides functions to perform the back-calculation in a Bayesian framework. It further provides a Bayesian model to fit the VBGC to the back-calculated data. Finally, it provides functions to visualize the results. This package is the first to provide both back-calculation and growth regression in a Bayesian framework. Can handle missing data (REF). These models have been verified and applied to estimate growth parameters of xxx coral reef species xx. This package is relevant because it can help fish researchers to estimate growth parameters evne when a limited amount of otoliths are available.
