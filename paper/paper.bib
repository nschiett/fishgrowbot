abstract = {Somatic growth is a critical biological trait for organismal, population, and ecosystem-level processes. Due to its direct link with energetic demands, growth also represents an important parameter to estimate energy and nutrient fluxes. For marine fishes, growth rate information is most frequently derived from sagittal otoliths, and most of the available data stems from studies on temperate species that are targeted by commercial fisheries. Although the analysis of otoliths is a powerful tool to estimate individual growth, the time-consuming nature of otolith processing is one barrier for collection of comprehensive datasets across multiple species. This is especially true for coral reef fishes, which are extremely diverse. Here, we provide back-calculated size-at-age estimates (including measures of uncertainty) based on sagittal otoliths from 710 individuals belonging to 45 coral reef fish species from French Polynesia. In addition, we provide Von Bertalanffy growth parameters which are useful to predict community level biomass production.},

abstract = {Abstract Energy flow and nutrient cycling dictate the functional role of organisms in ecosystems. Fishes are key vectors of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in aquatic systems, and the quantification of elemental fluxes is often achieved by coupling bioenergetics and stoichiometry. While nutrient limitation has been accounted for in several stoichiometric models, there is no current implementation that permits its incorporation into a bioenergetics approach to predict consumption rates. This may lead to biased estimates of elemental fluxes. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that combines stoichiometry and bioenergetics with explicit consideration of elemental limitations. We examine varying elemental limitations across different trophic groups and life stages through a case study of three trophically-distinct reef fishes. Further, we empirically validate our model using an independent database of measured excretion rates. Our model adequately predicts elemental fluxes in the examined species and reveals species- and size-specific limitations of C, N, and P. In line with theoretical predictions, we demonstrate that the herbivore Zebrasoma scopas is limited by N and P, and all three fish species are limited by P in early life stages. Further, we show that failing to account for nutrient limitation can result in a greater than two-fold underestimation of ingestion rates, which leads to severely biased excretion rates. Our model improved predictions of ingestion, excretion, and egestion rates across all life stages, especially for fishes with diets low in N and/or P. Due to its broad applicability, its reliance on many parameters that are well defined and widely accessible, and its straightforward implementation via the accompanying R-package fishflux, our model provides a user-friendly path toward a better understanding of ecosystem-wide nutrient cycling in the aquatic biome.},

abstract = {We developed a model of back-calculation of fish size from otoliths that could accommodate both changes in the relationship between otolith and somatic growth that occur through time and variation in growth rates among individuals. We used this model to back-calculate estimates of size and growth from otoliths of three species of Diplodus from the Mediterranean Sea. The outcomes of our model were compared with those of three other models and with growth curves estimated directly from populations of fish in the field. We found that our new model produced estimates of size-at-age that were closer to those observed in the field than the biological intercept, time-varying growth, and body proportional models. Comparison of profiles of increment width from otoliths of newly settled and juvenile Diplodus puntazzo and Diplodus vulgaris showed that these species formed a settlement mark, where increment width declined at settlement. In contrast, a settlement mark was not evident in the otoliths of Diplodus sargus. However, settlement of all species coincided with a sharp decline in somatic growth rate. Thus, growth rate may provide a means of estimating the timing of settlement in species that do not display a marked change in increment width.},

Back-calculation to reconstruct growth patterns from hard parts of fish (otoliths, bones and scales) followed soon after (Lea 1910). The approach involves using measurements made on these bony structures to infer, or back-calculate, body length at ages prior to capture.

Historical abundances of large consumer species were fantastically large in comparison with recent observations. Paleoecological, archaeological, and historical data show that time lags of decades to centuries occurred between the onset of overfishing and consequent changes in ecological communities, because unfished species of similar trophic level assumed the ecological roles of overfished species until they too were overfished or died of epidemic diseases related to overcrowding. Retrospective data not only help to clarify underlying causes and rates of ecological change, but they also demonstrate achievable goals for restoration and management of coastal ecosystems that could not even be contemplated based on the limited perspective of recent observations alone.},

abstract = {Model selection based on information theory is a relatively new paradigm in biological sciences with several advantages over the classical approaches. The aim of the present study was to apply information theory in the area of modelling fish growth and to show how model selection uncertainty may be taken into account when estimating growth parameters. The methodology was applied for length-age data of four species of fish, taken from the literature. Five-candidate models were fitted to each dataset: von Bertalanffy growth model (VBGM), generalized VBGM, Gompertz growth model, Schnute-Richards growth model, and logistic. In each case, the 'best' model was selected by minimizing the small-sample, bias-corrected form of the Akaike information criterion (AIC). To quantify the plausibility of each model, given the data and the set of five models, the 'Akaike weight' wiof each model was calculated. The average model was estimated for each case based on wi. Following a multi-model inference (MMI) approach, the model-averaged asymptotic length over(L, ̄)∞for each species was estimated, using all five models, by model-averaging estimations of L∞and weighting the prediction of each model by wi. In the examples of this study, model selection uncertainty caused a magnification of the standard error of the asymptotic length of the best model (up to 3.9 times) and thus in all four cases estimating L∞from just the best model would have caused overestimation of precision of the asymptotic length. The VBGM, when used for inference, without being the best model, could cause biased point estimation and false evaluation of precision. Model selection uncertainty should not be ignored even if VBGM is the best model. Multi-model inference by model-averaging, based on Akaike weights, is recommended for making robust parameter estimations and for dealing with uncertainty in model selection. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},
