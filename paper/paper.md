Summary
=======

Growth of animals is an essential biological process on the organismal,
population, and ecosystem-level. In the case of fishes, growth rate
information can be derived from otoliths, i.e. small calcium carbonate
structures located behind the brain. The age of a fish can be determined
by counting growth rings, i.e. white opaque zones intermetted by darker
translucent zones. On top of aging, individual growth trajectories can
be approximated by measuring the distances between the growth rings, and
transforming these to fish lengths, a process also called
back-calculation. This package provides functions to perform the
back-calculation process in a Bayesian framework. blabla
