# fishgrowbot: Fish growth curves through back-calculation of otoliths rings in a Bayesian framework    

The `fishgrowbot` package provides a tool to conduct back-calculation based on otolith readings and fit the Von Bertalanffy growth curve, both in a Bayesian framework.



# Installing and loading fishgrowbot

`fishgrowbot` uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations provided by
[stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).
Therefore, the first step is to install
[stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).

### GitHub

The best way to install the latest version of `fishgrowbot` is
to install it from GitHub.

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nschiett/fishgrowbot", dependencies=TRUE)
library(fishflux)
```

### CRAN

`fishgrowbot` will be available on CRAN in the future:

``` r
install.packages("fishgrowbot")
library(fishgrowbot)
```

# Use

Let's look at an example for *Epinephelus merra*

``` {r, bc, message= FALSE}
library(fishgrowbot)
library(dplyr)

# get data
em <- dplyr::filter(fishgrowbot::coral_reef_fishes_data, species == "Epinephelus merra", location == "Moorea")

# back-calculation
bc <- fishgrowbot::bcalc(data = em)$lengths
head(bc)
```

```{r, growthmodel, message = FALSE}
# fit growth model
growthmodel <-fishgrowbot::growthreg(length = bc$l_m/10, age = bc$age, id = bc$id, lmax = 32, linf_m = 30, chains = 1)

# summary growth parameters
growthmodel$summary
```
