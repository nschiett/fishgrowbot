# fishgrowbot: Fish growth curves through back-calculation of otoliths rings in a Bayesian framework    

The `fishgrowbot` package provides a tool to conduct back-calculation based on
otolith readings and fit the von Bertalanffy growth curve with a hierarchical
structure, both in a Bayesian framework.

It contains:

* A function `bcalc()` to perform the back-calculations which yields
length-at-age estimations with measures of uncertainty.

* A function called `growthreg()` to fit the von Bertalanffy growth model.

* Functions to visualize results.

## Installing and loading fishgrowbot

`fishgrowbot` uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations provided by
[stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).
Therefore, the first step is to install
[stan](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).

### GitHub

The best way to install the latest version of `fishgrowbot` is
to install it from GitHub.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nschiett/fishgrowbot", dependencies = TRUE)
library(fishgrowbot)
```

## Use
See the package documentation and introduction vignette.
